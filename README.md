The Expense Tracker App is a web-based personal finance manager that helps users track their fixed and extra expenses, set monthly budgets, and view expense history. It is lightweight, intuitive, and fully responsive, designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using localStorage for data persistence.
